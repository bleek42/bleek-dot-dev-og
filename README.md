### Overview

===========================================================================

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, but made from scratch otherwise. I made this for the purpose of demonstrating my knowledge of modern front-end web development to potential employers and furthering that knowledge along the way. Domain name provided by get.tech domains and hosted by Vercel, using their CLI tool for CI / CD. Based on my very first portfolio, which consisted of nothing more than vanilla HTML & CSS, I felt it was important for me to make a more dynamic, interactive experience with the aforementioned technologies I have grown comfortable using. Feel free to take ideas from this codebase or contact me if you find yourself lost on how everything works! I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it and don't be afraid to shoot some constructive criticism my way.

### Future Iterations of bleek.tech

##### Some ideas I've been kicking around...

===========================================================================

1. Node.js microservice for a contact form, with Nodemailer & Mailgun. I'd love for users to be able to send me emails with their name, subject, and a message right from my contact section!

2. Deployment on a Linux virtual machine with a provider (AWS, Linode, Azure, etc.) as the site grows in traffic and features.

3. Additional menu dropdown section for projects, allowing a user to navigate to each individual projects dedicated page, instead of having them all in one "Projects" component.

4. Refactoring all stateful logic into custom hooks with useReducer & useContext!

5. A dedicated landing page with an image of myself and a brief bio, using some sort of dropdown animation.

6. WebGL / Three.js animations in one (or maybe all!) sections of the site, with colorful and visually-pleasing textures.
